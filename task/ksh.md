# ksh env vars

ksh gives default values to      
`PATH, PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, MAILCHECK, FCEDIT, TMOUT, IFS`   
while   
`HOME, SHELL, ENV, MAIL`   
are not set at all by the shell, although `HOME` is set by *login(1)*.
On some systems `MAIL` and `SHELL` are also set by *login(1)*.

## Set by ksh

### KSH_VERSION
A name reference to .sh.version.

### LINENO
The current line number within the script or function being executed.

### OLDPWD
The previous working directory set by the cd command.

### OPTARG
The value of the last option argument processed by the getopts built-in command.

### OPTIND
The index of the last option argument processed by the getopts built-in command.

### PPID
The process number of the parent of the shell.

### PWD
The present working directory set by the cd command.

### RANDOM
Each time this variable is referenced, a random integer, uniformly distributed between 0 and 32767, is generated. The sequence of random numbers can be initialized by assigning a numeric value to RANDOM.

### REPLY
This variable is set by the select statement and by the read built-in command when no arguments are supplied.

### SECONDS
Each time this variable is referenced, the number of seconds since shell invocation is returned. If this variable is assigned a value, then the value returned upon reference will be the value that was assigned plus the number of seconds since the assignment.

### SHLVL
An integer variable the is incremented each time the shell is invoked and is exported. If SHLVL is not in the environment when the shell is invoked, it is set to 1.


## Used by ksh

The following variables are used by ksh:

### CDPATH
The search path for the `cd` command.

### COLUMNS
If this variable is set, the value is used to define the width of the edit window for the shell edit modes and for printing select lists.

### EDITOR
If the VISUAL variable is not set, the value of this variable will be checked for the patterns as described with VISUAL below and the corresponding editing option will be turned on.

### ENV
If this variable is set, then parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution are performed on the value to generate the pathname of the script that will be executed when the shell is invoked interactively. This file is typically used for alias and function definitions. The default value is `$HOME/.kshrc`. On systems that support a system wide `/etc/ksh.kshrc` initialization file, if the filename generated by the expansion of ENV begins with `/./` or `././` the system wide initialization file will not be executed.

### FCEDIT
Obsolete name for the default editor name for the `hist` command. FCEDIT is not used when HISTEDIT is set.

### FIGNORE
A pattern that defines the set of filenames that will be ignored when performing filename matching.

### FPATH
The search path for function definitions. The directories in this path are searched for a file with the same name as the function or command when a function with the -u attribute is referenced and when a command is not found. If an executable file with the name of that command is found, then it is read and executed in the current environment. Unlike PATH, the current directory must be represented explicitly by `.` rather than by adjacent `:` characters or a beginning or ending `:`.

### HISTCMD
Number of the current command in the history file.

### HISTEDIT
Name for the default editor name for the `hist` command.

### HISTFILE
If this variable is set when the shell is invoked, then the value is the pathname of the file that will be used to store the command history.

### HISTSIZE
If this variable is set when the shell is invoked, then the number of previously entered commands that are accessible by this shell will be greater than or equal to this number. The default is 512.

### HOME
The default argument (home directory) for the `cd` command.

### IFS
Internal field separators, normally space, tab, and newline that are used to separate the results of command substitution or parameter expansion and to separate fields with the `read` builtin. 

The first character of the IFS variable is used to separate arguments for the `$*` substitution.

Each single occurrence of an IFS character in the string to be split, that is not in the 'isspace' character class, and any adjacent characters in IFS that are in the 'isspace' character class, delimit a field. 

One or more characters in IFS that belong to the 'isspace' character class, delimit a field. 

In addition, if the same 'isspace' character appears consecutively inside IFS, this character is treated as if it were not in the 'isspace' class, so that if IFS consists of two tab characters, then two adjacent tab characters delimit a null field.

### JOBMAX
This variable defines the maximum number running background jobs that can run at a time. When this limit is reached, the shell will wait for a job to complete before staring a new job.

### LANG
This variable determines the locale category for any category not specifically selected with a variable starting with LC_ or LANG.

### LC_ALL
This variable overrides the value of the LANG variable and any other LC_ variable.

### LC_COLLATE
This variable determines the locale category for character collation information.

### LC_CTYPE
This variable determines the locale category for character handling functions. It determines the character classes for pattern matching.

### LC_NUMERIC
This variable determines the locale category for the decimal point character.

### LINES
If this variable is set, the value is used to determine the column length for printing select lists. Select lists will print vertically until about two-thirds of LINES lines are filled.

### MAIL
If this variable is set to the name of a mail file and the MAILPATH variable is not set, then the shell informs the user of arrival of mail in the specified file.

### MAILCHECK
This variable specifies how often (in seconds) the shell will check for changes in the modification time of any of the files specified by the MAILPATH or MAIL variables. The default value is 600 seconds. When the time has elapsed the shell will check before issuing the next prompt.

### MAILPATH
A colon-separated list of file names. If this variable is set, then the shell informs the user of any modifications to the specified files that have occurred within the last MAILCHECK seconds. Each file name can be followed by a `?` and a message that will be printed. The message will undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution with the variable `$_` defined as the name of the file that has changed. The default message is you have mail in `$_`.

### PATH
The search path for commands. The user may not change PATH if executing under `rksh` (except in .profile).

### PS1
The value of this variable is expanded for parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution to define the primary prompt string which by default is `$`. The character `!` in the primary prompt string is replaced by the command number. Two successive occurrences of `!` will produce a single `!` when the prompt string is printed.

### PS2
Secondary prompt string, by default `> `.

### PS3
Selection prompt string used within a select loop, by default `#? `.

### PS4
The value of this variable is expanded for parameter evaluation, command substitution, and arithmetic substitution and precedes each line of an execution trace. By default, PS4 is `+ `. In addition when PS4 is unset, the execution trace prompt is also `+ `.

### SHELL
The pathname of the shell is kept in the environment. At invocation, if the basename of this variable is `rsh`, `rksh`, or `krsh`, then the shell becomes restricted.

### TIMEFORMAT
The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the `time` reserved word should be displayed. 

The `%` character introduces a format sequence that is expanded to a time value or other information.

The format sequences and their meanings are as follows.

    %%          A literal %.
    %[p][l]R    The elapsed time in seconds.
    %[p][l]U    The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
    %[p][l]S    The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
    %P          The CPU percentage, computed as (U + S) / R.

The brackets denote optional portions. 

The optional p is a digit specifying the precision, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point. 

A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output. 

At most three places after the decimal point can be displayed; values of p greater than 3 are treated as 3. If p is not specified, the value 3 is used.

The optional l specifies a longer format, including hours if greater than zero, minutes, and seconds of the form `HHhMMmSS.FFs`.

The value of `p` determines whether or not the fraction is included.

All other characters are output without change and a trailing newline is added.

If unset, the default value, `$'\nreal\t%2lR\nuser\t%2lU\nsys%2lS'`, is used.

If the value is NULL, no timing information is displayed.

### TMOUT
If set to a value greater than zero, TMOUT will be the default timeout value for the read built-in command. The select compound command terminates after TMOUT seconds when input is from a terminal. Otherwise, the shell will terminate if a line is not entered within the prescribed number of seconds while reading from a terminal. (Note that the shell can be compiled with a maximum bound for this value which cannot be exceeded.)

### VISUAL
If the value of this variable matches the pattern `*[Vv][Ii]*`, then the *vi* option is turned on. If the value matches the pattern `*gmacs*`, the *gmacs* option is turned on. If the value matches the pattern `*macs*`, then the *emacs* option will be turned on. The value of VISUAL overrides the value of EDITOR.
